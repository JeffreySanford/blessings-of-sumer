#The Blessings of Sumer

Based on the ancient Sumerian stories from the culture that existed 
between the years 9000 and 6500 BCE, I am attempted to retell these 
mythologies in a historical fiction novel.

These mythologies can be viewed at the Oxford <a 
href="http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/">Electronic Text Corpus 
of Sumerian Literature</a>.  Other resource readers might enjoy will be 
the UCLS/Berlin project called the <a 
href="http://cdli.ucla.edu/">CDLI</a>.  

As a new and amatuer author, I welcome all comments and criticisms.  I 
am creating these texts with gitbook and will impliment comments on he 
articles and sections as time goes along.  In the meantime, I can be 
contacted at <a
