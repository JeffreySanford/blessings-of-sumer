<p>We continued onto the land of Erech.  In this land the women of the tribe had developed the most exclusive art of spinning the wool from the neighboring Bad-tibra where the sheep were raise.  In creating this wool, they can take it and weave it like a spider.</p>
<p>What words could describe the beauty of meeting Uttu for the first time, she seem to glow with an aura of gold, all the time, morning and night.  Her magnificent nature glorifies the heavens themselves!  Her golden hair in those years was so fine it seemed as if the town elder woman had spun the gold from the neighboring lands to create a wig for her.  Her eye blazed into your at first sight and seemed to stay transfixed just your you the entire time that you are in her company, even though other will tell you that she was looking at them.  Her majesty, as a queen, could already be understood at first sound uttered from her lips.  How sweet the nectarous words become as they fall from her lips.  The gentle breeze even seems to be excited as it plays amongst the bangs of her brow.</p>
<p>She had already established vast beautiful gardens in her city.  It seemed to me that fifteen miles in each direction had been developed.  The people seemed to be very happy and even proud that they were citizens in the city of the loveliest ladies in the countries of Sumer.   Enki giggled at the idea but I saw with my own wide eyes that it was true, so many lovely women lived here it was unusual.  I had been on board ship or on a canal checking for leaks for months.  Yet I was still on the job, no time for play.</p>
<p>The people here had built the reed house and also the new brick-house, which was very appeal to both the eye and the mind.    The land was bursting with vegetables and fruits, cucumber fields, apple trees and grape vines seemed to be as far as they eye could see.</p>
<p>The sun was so hot bearing down upon our teams as they removed the dirt and packed the canal and dyke molds.  Sweat was rolling from our skin, dripping onto the ground creating pools.  The skies were clear with no clouds to be seen at all.  Utu, the power of the Sun, was so bright and seemed so very close to the earth this day.  It was so hot, that as it shone down upon our frail cracked skin and upon the ground, not frail but it cracks just the same as our skin.</p>
<p>Utu was born when the Anuna, the descendant of the father An, had came down from the original mountain and after Enlil had met Ninlil.  The Lord of Air and the Lady of Air, Enlil and Ninlil, both now sit at the head of the Anunnaki, the divine assemble of the descendants of An.  The council of Anunnaki decrees the destinies for all the people of the land.  Utu, has three brothers, two older; Nanna and Nergal, respectfully the power of the Moon and the power of the planet Mars.  His younger brother Ninurta is the farmer of Enlil.  Utu has houses in Sippar and Larsa, he establishes the measures of the land, for example the weights used in weighing our grain or standardization of the bricks that are used in house building.  Utu is also very knowledgeable about the time too reap thing, he understand when the grain is at the perfect height, no more yield will be produce and it will start to die on the stalk.</p>
<p>As An has taken responsibility of the heavens, Enlil the responsibility for the earth regions and Enki the regions of the swamps, Utu has taken the responsibility for the powers of the Sun.  This is part of the mysteries for the DurAnKi, the bond between heaven and earth.  In the same way the moon, which watches over all the spirits on this planet when the sun cannot see any longer, with responsibilities assigned to Nanna watch over the ethics, morals and laws for the land.</p>
<p>As I send water around to the people of the teams they thank me gratefully.  The land here, about 20 miles from the shoreline of the gulf, was very fertile.  The loam that the soil had created was amazingly deep and rich soil.  It seemed as if you could taste and smell the life that was contained within, just waiting to spring to life.</p>
<p>We would establish the canal system, and then we would build in the dykes.  Only then could we loose the bolts that hold back the water and let the waters fill the canals to the field gates.  We would then release the field gates on the dykes which would fill the fallows, watering the fields entirely.</p>
<p>We had flooded the canal system for the second time, when a fair maiden, dress quite fine walked up behind Enki.  &#x201C;Well, I guess they will let anyone work on these canal teams, even those that are hung-over!&#x201D; she said to Enki.  Enki glared up at me, before realizing who it was.  He then smiled knowingly, a smile that seemed to stretch his ear and said, &#x201C;It does seem so indeed my lady, it also seems to me that a woman that came from the streets,  woman that had no significant mother in her life has gone on to create a most lovely city.  This city is beyond wonder Uttu!  How have you been?&#x201D;  Uttu, the beautiful lady, reached out to be in Enki&apos;s arms as she said, &#x201C;We have all been good, after the shrine of Ur was built, people started to gather in this area.  It does seem that this city does have somewhat of a spirit does it not?  Would you not think this would be the perfect city to represent your ideas on how this divine assembly should be seen?  It is truly lovely.  It is a jewel of heart of all the KiUr!&#x201D;  Enki pondered her statement.</p>
<p>It was true that Uruk had created itself in one of the finest aspects of the divine assembly.  These cities sprung up in glory from the ground like plants, the enthusiasm exhibited by the locals was an incredible sight, one that he could have never imagined when he stated the planning for this.  But Uttu was still young to rule an entire nation.  What had once been a dream, in the very near past, had almost instantly increased itself and to the point that already there is the hustle-bustle of bazaars in the city, couples, whether arm in arm or arguing, manors, shrine, canals.  His head was swimming; this was the fourth of four canal system, the last of the canal system that they will install at this point.  &#x201C;I need a break.  Isimud, how does some beer, cheese and bread sound to you?&#x201D;  &#x201C;Best idea I have heard all day, my Lord&#x201D; I told him.  &#x201C;Uttu, would you honor us with your company?&#x201D; He asked Uttu.  She replied, &#x201C;No, not quite yet, I still have much to do now that you have established the Uruk canal bisect.  If you would care to join me this evening for dinner, I would enjoy discussing things a bit more.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Enki and the beautiful lady sat and spoke for a while.  She told Enki that Nintu had come by too see the city the other day and that she had cautioned her about Enki.  Ninlil had told Uttu that Enki could see up into Larsa, Ur and Erech but that is all that he can do.  The distant between the lands is like ten miles and if they were attacked, Enki could not reinforce them fast enough.  Nintu had told Inanna to establish Bad-tibra, where the King Dumuzid had already established his city.  &#x201C;I am not too worried about foreign invaders here in this city, Lord Enki.  It is perhaps the Rightful Rule, the blessings of Ninsar that concern me more.  Tell me more about these tablets of destinies that you have access to in your library that you mentioned?&#x201D;  The beauty sat across from Enki with unwavering gaze.   Enki, on the other hand, squirmed in his seat &#x201C;well, my lady, some of the local marauding tribes in this area can...&#x201D;  She cut the wise lord short &#x201C;Don&apos;t get me wrong lord, I can hold a blade of three different sizes, I have been well trained in the arts of defense and attack.  I was just wondering how the rule was going to be allotted across the land.&#x201D;</p>
<p>{Enki explains how any could rule if they were to get the blessing of Nippur, the blessing of the divine assembly.  King or Queen?  Of course, why not?  Why would gender play a role?  Which is better to be the Lord of a realm?  Inanna is forcing an issue about the patriarchal terms of the new arrangement, very cozy of  Enlil and Enki being allot the divine heaven and Earth.  The Goddesses of the land had established the cities, why is it that the men get to take over the cities? &#x201C; I am firstborn son of An.&#x201D; we will establish as  shrine of An, you can be mistress of An (since she is not a citizen of the country of Kish, yet there by establishing her tie to the power of An)  My lady I am not here to disparage you, I am here to bring the Erech it&apos;s watercourse.  We have not come to establish that which can only be established by the mouthpiece of An, your father.&#x201D; &#x201C;well, I was just saying, if there comes a time that rulership should be decided, I would like my city to be at least considered.&#x201D;  Interesting different queen, always looking to put her city forward of the rest, for her city to be successful.    Not in defiance of the Anunaki but she wants to real already at this time.]</p>
<p>[Reference the World Order myth, and the disparages that Inana think that she incurs.]
[This almost seems like an argument but Inana is just trying to charm Enki, perhaps for a more lofty position than the weaver of the land.  It&apos;s essential Inanna create the beautiful garments that will be the renowned on the west-west caravan line, in the southern region and those areas way north in the ice.]</p>
<p>Enki tries to set the destiny of the new trees outside even though Uttu and Ninhursag were growing new trees for the nation of Sumer.</p>
<p>{Enki gets sick of course.  Ninhursag tells Enki of the destinies the trees}</p>
<p>Nintu came by the other day and informed me that &#x201C;Nintud said to Uttu: &quot;Let me advise you, and may you take heed of my advice. Let me speak words to you and may you heed my words. From in the marsh one man is able to see up here, is able to see up here, he is; from in the marsh Enki is able to see up here, is able to see up here, he is. He will set eyes on you.&quot;</p>
<p>Enki approached Uttu house, who is it, &#x201C;It the gardener bearing lots of cucumbers, apples and grapes!</p>
<blockquote>

<p>152-158 When he was filling with water a second time, he filled the dykes with water, he filled the canals with water, he filled the fallows with water. The gardener in his joy rose (?) from the dust and embraced him: &quot;Who are you who ...... the garden?&quot;</p>
