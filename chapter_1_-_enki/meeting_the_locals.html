<p>[Voice of Ninsikila &#x2013; first person]
We met Martu in the new land.  I had been so excited to get off that damned boat.  It was a wonderful boat but it was still a boat and I didn&apos;t seem to be born of the water like Enki was.  He seemed to be a fish when he was a young boy, always in the water, always wanting to go to the lake.  His latest obsession with this boat is magnificent.  He calls it little but we bring 3 massive bulls, 10 cows, 1 baby calf that is mine named Gracie, six goats, four sheep, two horses along with vast quantities of water, mead of course, and our rations.  Enki brings the Martu people a bull and three cows.  He told them how to milk the cows, he told them how to breed them, and they knew how to eat them.  They were a very bright people, very intelligent; they understood him right away and thanked him profusely.</p>
<p>Martu&apos;s people&apos;s eyes were so very wide in seeing us arrive on the Stag of the Absu.  Enki truly is an impressive man both in stature and wisdom.  As Enki disembarked, the Martu&apos;s eyes were the size of the moon and their chins seemed to drag on the ground.  They seemed as if they saw an alien from another planet disembarking from a spaceship.  But soon they realized that we were just as they were, that we enjoyed the same things, that we needed the same things.</p>
<p>My beloved, oh yes that Lord of Heaven and Earth, that ancient wise one from the deep oceans of Nammu, that one with the wisdom of the Absu and the bitter rivers, seas and ocean learned another lesson that day as he blundered forth, excited to meet other people, excited to find the new land.  Enki hit a deep spot in the shoreline and disappear under the waves.  Back on top and fine but very wet and embarrassed, he met the Martu.  The Martu, upon seeing this course of events, lost their air of cautiousness and fell on the ground laughing.  They brought him blankets, and food, a mash of garbanzo beans, sesame and garlic paste and juice of lemons.</p>
<p>I remember in those early days, I asked them what they called this mash and they asked me, &#x201C;What is it to call something?   How are we supposed to call it?  It just is.&#x201D;  They knew not the art of giving things names so that they can be classify and studied; something totally foreign to my mind.  I had to classify everything; I think I got that tendency from Enki growing up.  By classification, we can study and understand the nature of things here.  By giving it a name, it seems to me, that it gives the thing a spirit, something that our mind can relate with.  Anyways, they did not think this way at all.  They knew not the calling of name of seasons, they did not track the thirteen moons of the wheel of life, nor the degrees of the sun, but they did track the stars and they could travel by that.  The knew that the sun rose in the east and set in the west and in this knowing they were confident to face a very large and foreboding world.</p>
<p>They were nomads, a people that traveled everywhere it seemed, all through the lands, they knew so many ways of saying hello.  They truly were a wonderful people.  They travel from the lands of the south, the lands of Meluhha, which has vast quantities of gold that they have pledged to our purpose.  The land mast to the south is vast and we have made wanderings, as Enki likes to call them.</p>
<p>Enki told me that one day, a long time ago this manifest existence started there on that land mass.  Humans started to walk on the earth, on that face of Ki.  I giggled and told him that they must have been like monkeys at that point.  He glared at me, in my ignorance and misunderstanding, and told me the amazing fact of the situation was that they were just as brilliant as we were but they had not yet understood the necessity of this manifestation.  There were reasons why but those mysteries were as deep as the very ocean itself, as lofty as Ki&apos;s magnificent mountain peaks her sacred breasts that rolled over the land here.</p>
<p>They have so many magnificent stories to tell us as the day slips into night and the night erupts into brilliant light as campfires consume their fuel giving us warmth and light.  They served the beer but they had date syrup that they added to the beer that made it very strong and so very sweet and also lots of fresh water.  They knew all the natural springs in this area.  I giggle to myself as I write this that my knowledge of this manifested existence I think as that I know is all that is.  But the Martu knew all the springs in lands very far and distant from here.</p>
<p>From listening to their stories, I sit in the dust in realization of my ignorance of this new world.  So many new adventures I look forward to!  Raising a family in the beauty of this new land sounds like a perfect dream to me.  Sitting in the dust feel very good to me as I listen to the drums and the beautiful dancing girls swirl around me.  Truly, this is a dream.  One must dream before it can be thought; only when it is thought can work bring it into manifest existence through necessity, there must be a need.</p>
<p>Long discussions about how things would be arranged in those years, the Martu were very helpful in telling us about the local area, the local peoples.  We traveled to the beautiful lands of Meluhha and Magan and they, for some reason, treated me like their queen.  They are such a dear sweet people, so honorable and hard working.  One night, as we sat around the campfire of the Martu, I think we were on the straights between the continent of Meluhha and Dilmun, I heard the men discuss things, as is their way.</p>
<p>Enki told the Martu, &#x201C;You can be like the Igigi, the young members of our tribe, the descendants of An, you could serve in the new shrines of the Land.  We need help building the canals, growing the crops.  We need intelligent minds to work...&#x201D;  Martu interrupted Enki&apos;s decree of destiny and told him about the nature of things.  &#x201C;Lord, let me explain it as we explain it to our children, Lord of much wisdom, hear our stories and may it please you ears, warm your heart and inspire your mind.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;One of our young warriors was on top of the mountain, playing his drum, which smoothed the heart.  He spent days up there crying for a vision, for himself and our tribe.  When he had seen his vision, he started back down the mountain to meet our caravan.  Our caravan was traveling the areas between Meluhha and Magan and the northern regions, where the great east-west trade routes exist.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Martu continued to entrance Enki with the story, &#x201C;Our young warrior was traveling downhill to meet us again.  Just then, Snake came up and asked him &#x201C;Oh great and strong warrior, carry me down the mountain!  Oh great and mighty warrior of the Martu who travel all the Lands, carry me down the mountain!  You are so mighty the journey would take you one day, whereas the journey would take me a month!  Oh honorable warrior, treat the humble creatures well and bring honor on your family, carry me down the mountain!&#x201D; Of course, the warrior told Snake, &#x201C;If I pick you up, surly you will bite me.  If I carry you down the mountain, surely you will bite me.  If I carry you to my caravan, surely you will bite me and perhaps you will bite the people of my family!&#x201D;  The warrior continued to walk down the mountain but Snake followed.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Snake look at him, with his head low and said, &#x201C;Mighty warrior, how could I bite someone as mighty and strong as you?  How could I bite someone who is such a strong warrior?  How could I bite someone who is a friend or family of such a strong warrior? Carry me down the mountain!  I will tell you the mystery of the nature of things!  You can be warrior of the Martu!  Carry me down the mountain!&#x201D;  On that day, under that Sun, in that moon, on this Earth, it did indeed happen.&#x201D;  The wise elder of the Martu spun the tale for Enki&apos;s amusement.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The young warrior fell for the cunning of Snake and did indeed carry him down the mountain.  Snake, true to his word, did indeed tell him the mysteries of the nature of things.  When they got down to the caravan, the young warrior with much joy and excitement came to his elders to tell them the mysteries of nature that Snake had told him.  Then, as is the nature of Snake, Snake bit him and he died.&#x201D;  The wise one of the Martu and the wise one of Nammu and An starred into the campfire quietly, contemplatively.</p>
<p>Enki fell on the ground laughing. I love his laugh, deep, resounding like the sea, bellowing like the winds here.  He seems to glow golden as he laughed so much with the Martu, I can see that he is best when he is with people, amongst the masses, talking, dancing, drinking.  Enki understood what the Martu meant; the Martu&apos;s nature was to travel, just as his nature was to wander.  They agree to a friendship that existed for so many years.</p>
<p>We many spent days and nights in the tents of the Martu, traveling with them to the lands of Meluhha and Magan through the straights that connect the land masses.    Evermore will I remember those days, those days before sickness, those days learning from the Martu, those days before old age ravaged humankind, before the laws, standards and morals had been establish, We sat with the Martu teaching them before our journey to the east, to our island.</p>
<p>That beautiful island of Dilmun, situated within, what I hope will be beautiful reed marshlands with carp dancing amongst them, now is a stinky swamp.  I agree that while it will require work to create what we want, but the reward is in the work itself and the locals are such a wonderful people.  We have so much to do, for the people her, for us.  Enki has decided that it truly is here that we will live and set up my city, in the marshlands, at the island of Dilmun.</p>
