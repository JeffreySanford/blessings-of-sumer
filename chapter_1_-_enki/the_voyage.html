<p>We have already wandered for so long, we have journeyed in my little boat along the coast, heading for the land of Dilmun, the area of destination that my brother Enlil had pointed out on his map, so long ago.  My brother has left on foot and is traveling across the land, living in tents. Surely his scenery is better than the vast spaciousness of the ocean, the glistening waters of the Absu.  The small waves crash against the Stag of of the Absu endlessly, day and night lulling one into a contemplative mood so I choose to record this journey and why both of us have intended on making it.</p>
<p>By following the coastline and keeping it on my right hand, we should arrive in the Gulf of Dilmun.  Only the strongest of boats and human alike could make this journey, I am proud of myself and my crew.  There were no problems with this voyage, it is almost relaxing, if only the events were different.  My little boat is so luxurious, at times I feel more at home on The Stag than I do at my actually home.</p>
<p>My trustworthy boat the Stag of the Absu is finer than I could have ever expected.  I had tested the mighty Stag on rough waters, but the journey that we have almost completed has been a magnificent test for the little boat.  Little but strong, I think to myself.  Not since I was a child had we ventured this far from home however.  Never as I child would I have expect for these events to have occurred.</p>
<p>I am still shaken from undergoing the extreme change in how things have been for so long.  The shoreline on my right hand side seems to calms me as my trustworthy ship carries me gently over the waves and my sail propels me forward.  It is comforting having the shoreline to navigate with, this land has existed for so long however it seems that it could not change.  I know physically, we are wandering along the southern portion of the land mass that my father An and brother Enlil are traveling on foot.</p>
<p>The vastness of the Absu, Nammu my mother manifested is so wonderfully overwhelming to view.  Her spirit embraces any who dare gaze at her, those with inner courage of that of a lion dare to travel out on her fair skin.  I was born on these salty waters, my sister, Ereshkigal, to the sweet waters.</p>
<p>My father had always had a deep admiration for the gorgeous waters of this planet.  Traveling across the mysteries of Nammu; the oceans, the rivers, the canals, the mighty Absu of fresh, sweet waters his mind began to swim as his little boat bobbed on the water, like a leaf gentle guided downstream.  The boat itself, The Stag of the Absu, was a marvel of maritime perfection.</p>
<p>He had worked so very hard, trying to find the strongest wood to create the bow.  This adventure had been a good test for the boat, at time he was concern too hard of a test, but it came through with flying colors.  Nammu must have approved to the Stag of the Absu.  The waters were a sweet goddess but unforgiving for the foolish ventured out onto her skin unprepared.  But for the trained, for the wise it could be an amazing adventure.  Whether he was a wise or a fool in the voyage, in these wanderings so far from home, was yet to be seen.  As the waves gently caressed the coastline in its cleansing waters, as the might Stag of the Absu pushed forward as was its course and fate, Enki at the helm dreamed.</p>
<p>“Listen, my son, you were born on these waters.” Enki seemed to hear his mother’s voice, Nammu coming from the midst of the deep.  “You are mine and I am yours, I sit in esteem of the intelligence that you have become.  You have learned well your Arts.” He recognized his mother’s voice.  She continued as he sat, pondered and sailed.  Quietly Enki sailed towards destiny, he sat quietly and thought about the words he heard from the deep waters.</p>
<p>“You are traveling to a distant land and even though you don&#39;t know why, I do.  You have told yourself that you are just wandering but know that there is a bigger plan behind the scenes.  This manifest existence is brought about because of necessity.  I need you, just as you need me.”</p>
<p>“Establish in this land standards.  Do not be greedy, do not horde, but instead take care of the items that you hold precious.  Give the items a spirit, take care of them as if they were alive as they actually are alive, they are part of the manifested existence that you are a part of, vibrating at a much lower frequency than you.”</p>
<p>“Establish in this new land, this manifestation existence, this existence that is entirely created out of necessity, fresh water through out the land so people may stop and refresh themselves from there travels in the land.  Establish shrines in the north and the south, east and west, establish the House of the Blessing of your father An and his most cherished wives throughout the lands, in the lands of heaven and of earth.  Let it never be said in the land of Sumer, “I am thirsty.”  Make ovens at these places of the land, let the ovens be made to work, let the people be made to work, have the people working in the travelers shrines be as a mother and father, brother and sister to strangers, friends or family alike.  Let them bake bread for their friends and strangers alike.  Let it never be said in the land of Sumer, “I am hungry.”  These things son are very important, do not forget these things, Enki, write them down, and do not delay!”</p>
<p>“Know that I will use you to protect the peoples of this planet.  That is your one and only purpose here son, to watch over the peoples of this land as a shepherd.  The rest will come with time.  You must trust me that these troubling times are for a greater purpose one that will bring Life to this planet, bringing ideal such as Freedom, Truth and Justice to civilization for there is Freedom in doing what you are supposed to be doing, there is a truth but it will always be veiled so as to keep you searching and inquisitive and Justice so that this Life may continue.</p>
<p>“Without these ideals, my son, and the times will come, over and over again to keep their spirit alive, this world will fall into tyranny, oppressors of the people whether it be a man or an ideology, hatred for others and other ideals because they are different than oneself, without justice the mighty will overtake the weak, the orphan and the widow will go without, there will exist “those that have” and “those that know” in juxtaposition to “those that have not” and “those that know not.”</p>
<p>These, my dear and only hope for success, will certainly be a time of despair for most of the people of the planet.  Protect the fool and the wise one alike, for they both elevated the definition of fool and wise at times.  They will think they are alone, they will hide in their house afraid of weapons, criminals, weather, the sun, afraid of who they have been told to be afraid of.  Instead of love they will only know fear.  Instead of hope, they will only know hatred.  Instead of faith, they will only know money.  Truly they will live in fear, without belief, faith, or hope.  I expect you to protect all the people, my spring of hope eternal, better than you protect your wife, sister, brother, father or mother.  Listen to these words, remember these words and you will see how you can help them, and in turn they can help those that come.”</p>
<p>“There is a spirit of truth and it is not subjective but is alive.  It is very simple, so simple that it is confusing to many in this world of manifested existence, in this world that was created entirely out of necessity, and the righteous hold the secret of truth.  There is a spirit of justice and it is not entitled but is alive.  It is very simple, so simple that it is confusing to many in this world of manifested existence, in this world that was created entirely out of necessity, and the humble hold the secret of justice.  There is a spirit of freedom and it is not obligatory but is alive.  It is very simple, so simple that it is confusing to many in this world of manifested existence, in this world that was created entirely out of necessity, and the cheerful hold the secret of freedom.”</p>
<p>“The people that have of these times, in their ignorance and arrogance, will use details of difference for their prejudice; skin color, eye color, whether a person is tall or short, large or skinny.  You will know these times of ignorance in the lack of knowledge of truth, justice and freedom.  You have all been created equally, what you choose to do in action will shape this world and your own spirit.  What you choose to do in action, in this world, in this manifestation of existence that was entirely formed out of necessity, creates effect on this world and on your spirit.  These effects shape this world.  Let your effects benefit the life of this world, not be malevolent.”</p>
<p>“There is only one true race, human.  It is why we use the words the human race.  There is only one way to experience kindness, through humans, hence we are called humankind.  There is only one way for life on this planet to experience liberty, that I through action and the freedom of doing what is your part in this world.  In the worse times of this world, freedom will come to mean there is nothing left to lose.”</p>
<p>“Freedom, justice and truth must walk hand in hand through out the ages in order to be effective, loss of one enables the others to dominate all.  My dear son, create a world, create your world, so beautifully that people will never be able to forget it, so in those times of despair, when justice only means the ability to enslave others, when truth means some persons insane thoughts, when even speaking the word freedom causes the ignorant to hang their fears in trees, to burn their fears, to feed their fears to lions, in those times my son, they will remember your words, your ideals and your world, that world that you are about to create.”</p>
<p>Enki stirred uneasily in his seat at the helm as he dismissed the voice to the long voyage, the hypnotic effect of the waves crashing against the side of the boat.  He was in such a philosophical mood as he came into the gulf, the end of his journey.  He expected to be exhilarated but instead he felt anxious.  Where he expected to find exaltation, he finds concern for the future.  “I need beauty in my world.” he thought to himself, “I need to feel the elements of creation at work.  I need to feel the gentleness of the air bringing ideas and hints of new beginnings or the ebb and flow of the pull of the lovely moon and it gently caressing the world into action.”</p>
<p>“The richness of the soil, the very earth in my hand feels the essence of life teaming, a waiting potential more fierce than any power.  Just to feel the sun shine down from its fiery sphere of influence against my face as I wake in the morning will make all these events and travels worth it.  To exist, to question, to frequent the shrines, to consume, to enjoy the bounty of the land, to be thankful and openly give thanks for everything that has been provided for us.  I will be an instrument of creation and, in turn, destruction.”</p>
<p>In this new world, I find my own beauty to be appealing and erotic, to myself and others.  Actually, everything recently has been making me feel erotic.  It must be the an effect of the salt air that boosts my libido, or just progressing in a positive direction, an overwhelming sense of urgency, anxiety and excitement builds with each wave the pounds against the ship.</p>
<p>I am amazed at the vastness of the oceans of this world, the seeming gentleness that the oceans hold the land masses in gentle embrace.  My first feeling of amazement was my beautiful queen who has been with me since my earliest years.  I grew up with Ninsikila in a very far distant land, one that slips from my mind now and leaves me with an empty, haunted feeling.  I look forward to the future, look forward to the future with her, looking forward to the future here in this new land with her.  These things bring me comfort.</p>
<p>Sometimes I think she believes more in me than I believe in myself.  She sits across from me amazed in her beautiful white wrap; it shines like a metal against her chocolate skin.   Such a strong heart she has, a heart of a lion.  She will be my strength in this new land.  She content to eat and drink our rations that we have brought along even though they are meager, to enjoy the new lands and waters and everything about this land seemed new, teaming with life.</p>
<p>She is truly amazing that she has adapted so well to traveling aboard the Stag.  She will serve as a gracious queen in this new realm, a model to the queens throughout the Sar cycle to come of this realm.  She always cares for her people first, she is my perfect ideal of a queen.</p>
<p>This manifestation existence, brought about through necessity has created for her a new potential, perfect for her, a place I like to call Dilmun, which is located on an island east of our current destination, in the marsh lands.  I am positive that it will turn into a beautiful city with hard work.</p>
<p>Hard work is still a complex idea for my mind, this manifestation existence, brought about through necessity, to work to manifest things into existence.  It is quite easier just to manifest them through the tablets of destiny but the action of doing and creating brings many variables that have never been in existence.   People don&#39;t take care of things that they are given; I have seen it with my own eyes.</p>
<p>If they were not involved in earning through work that item, they very seldom care for it as they would something they created or had to earn to be in possession of.  The tablets of destiny are limited to the infinite possibilities of it existence but only what is known in its existence.  This Great Work creates that which never before had Need.  The necessity of the situation creates its own solution, that is, existence. It augments the weave of fate mixing destiny with colors rich and vibrant of the unknown element of this reality.</p>
<p>I have noticed, as we get closer to the destination, more and more people can be seen.  They seem to gather into tribes then into small villages.  The once sparse land, of rolling hills and bluffs which seemed as if no foot had ever tread upon it now reveals it secret of nurturing the local inhabitants that had quite successfully adapted to their environment.   I will bring them gifts if they are neighbors.</p>
<p>I can see land where we are to land so I will stop recording this journal for the time being.  I need to remember to journal these thoughts and experiences.  My brother Enlil was correct, I may remember the old ways but this new perspective of things make it hard to remember the details of the linear reality of manifestation in the time and space.</p>
