<p>(voice of Isimud, enki&#39;s messenger)
I am so thankfully to Enki, that sweet name of Heaven, for teaching me the scribal arts.  I am attempting at his suggestion, to record some of my thoughts about the current situation of events in the Land of Sumer.  I am Enki&#39;s minister, sometimes a servant, sometimes his most trusted adviser.  I am trained in all the established laws of the Anuna, the scribal arts, the establishment of name, times and places.  I came in service to Enki of my own accord when I was very young.  We grew up in the water together. I still enjoy spending as much time as I can in the great waters of the Nammu.  Eridu is the city of my heart and here I wanted to record some of the stories of how we created Eridu and those other early cities.</p>
<p>One night as Enki and Nintu sat together, after they had drunk their fill and eaten what satisfied them, they sat talking amongst themselves.  In those days before the E.Absu had been built they say in a reed hut, in the midst of the swamps of the new land.  In that reed hut, Nintu and Enki laughed and told stories, Enki flirted with Nintu as she ignored his advances.  In that reed hut, many moons ago, it did indeed happen.</p>
<p>The reed hut was a marvel in itself but was taught to Enki from the madan people that lived here in this marshy region.  Without worry or strife, these people have lived here since before the sun had a name, they had in fact even built a shrine to the holy mountain, the Mother Ninhursag in their region west of Ur.  They had taught Enki to take the reeds of the marsh that grew here and weave them in such a way that a house could be created.  And not just a small hut but a marvelous house, a house with a sleeping chambers, a kitchen, even a common area for entertaining.  Enki, along with the help of the Madan, created a stairway from the reed house to the mooring pole of the Stag of the Absu.</p>
<p>Enki had been attempting all evening to get Nintu into his new bedchambers that he has built in his reed hut.   Nintu was a beautiful woman, when she moved it seemed as if the trees moved with her.  When she sighed it seemed as if the four winds sighed with her.  She was much shorter than Enki, her femininely shapes reminded Enki of the land here, how it seemed to roll into mountains, then into valleys, then into the sea.  She embodied softness as opposed to the hardness of his body.  She was marvelously beautiful but seemed totally uninterested in him.  Enki was shocked at first actually because he had become very accustomed to women finding him quite appealing.</p>
<p>After many unsuccessful attempts at courtship, there fell a silence over the reed hut and the two started to talk about the water situation in the Kiur, the land of Sumer.  Enki had already conceived the plan of bringing the waters to the cities of the northern regions.  Enki explained to Nintu about the large aquifer that runs through the underground underneath the land, the underworld, and how it cleansed and purity the sweet waters.  He told of his plans of increasing this water in the underworld, as well as diverting the waters of the Euphrates to her city, into the Tigris.  Enki had created a map of the region and set it on the tale for Nintu to understand better.</p>
<p>Enki explained to the wise midwife of the Land that there were two major canal systems in his plans; The Shuruppak Canal System and the Lagash Canal System.  These both end in protectors of the Land, Nergal in Shuruppak and Ninurta in Lagash that could sail up stream all the way to Sippar if any enemies were to come drifting down stream while the life giving waters drift downstream into the cities.  From both their realms in the south, with the help of Ur, Eridu and Larsa, all coastal naval cities they could defend the entire nation against sea attack.</p>
<p>Nintu, in a flash, understood the need for this plan and all its ramifications.  Instead of the people having to carry water over land from the rivers to the cities, the cities could be bathed in virtually unlimited waters.  The fields could be irrigated.  The house could have fresh water for drinking, cooking and bathing.  All the cities would prosper, as they received the waters of Enki&#39;s plan.  “We thought of this idea for my city in Umma, directing water from the Tigris through a canal but it would take us about nine months of back breaking work according to my council of elders.”  Nintu told Enki.</p>
<p>Enki pondered for a moment and then continued “My sweet lady, with my wisdom and my charms things happen!  You have to sleep with me!  Come let us embrace, I will bring water to your city!  Let me bring my essence to your womb!  Sweet daughter of the Holy Mountain, I shall bring in nine days what would take nine months, I will bring the sweet waters into your city so that they overflow, I will fill your city with abundance and prosperity like my Absu.  You are so lovely, let me kiss you, let me pour my semen into your womb as I plan to pour water into the wells of your city!”</p>
<p>She giggled at Enki and batting her eyelids she told Enki, “Sweet Name of Heaven, Enki, if you turn my land into a swampland, you will never see my bed chambers.”   Enki sat in the dust at what she was indicating, and also the point that she was correct. That much water into the city of Umma would indeed turn her lands into a swamp.  If the waters of the Euphrates were dumped into the region, the entire land would turn into a swamp, good for the marsh but bad for the lands of cattle, sheep, and grain. “I will create a reservoir system above, in the lands of the heavenly abode, that will hold he water until we need it, then we can flood the fields and then create another large canal that will carry the waters back to the Euphrates in Adab.  This way the two Mothers of the Land can receive the precious waters without fear of flooding”</p>
<p>He revised the plans to include the Umma and Larsa bisect. There would exist connections from the city of Umma to the city of Larsa, any excess water in Nintu&#39;s city to the drain down to the south west to the river Euphrates.  “This will create a man eating river by Larsa and Erech.  We must tell the children to stay clear of this area.  Many a younger one will be swept downstream to their death.  This plan will only allow one means access by water to the lands of Lagash.” Nintu told Enki as she pondered his drawings on the map.   “I will connect with a ferry between Lagash and the emporium of the Land, Larsa.  “I do believe that you might even be cleverer than your father, Enki.” Nintu explained to Enki as the midnight hours slipped into morning.</p>
<p>So Enki devised a reservoir between the lands of Kutu and Adab, Ninhursag&#39;s city.  This will enable regulation of the amount of water coming through from the Euphrates and the controls will be established from the Lake, the source waters of the Tigris that could regulate the sweet waters of that powerful river.</p>
<p>First he created the dry “large canal” systems with smaller connecting canals that brought the sweet waters of the Tigris to the cities of cities of Sippar, Kish, Nippur, Shuruppak, Erech and Ur.  Then he created the dry “large canal” systems connecting Sippar, Kutu, Lake Enki, Adab, Umma, [Girsu] and Lagash.</p>
<p>This new confluence of rivers creates the “man-eating river” of Ninlil and Enlil.  Three major tributaries; the original Euphrates, the canal connect Sippar to Kish to Nippur to Shuruppak to Larsa and the canal that connects Sippar to Kutu to Lake [Hamner?] to Adab to Umma to Wall of Girsu to Lagash.  This created first two positions for the Igigi; the man of the man-eating river, who stands guard at the confluence of the mighty rivers and the man of the ferryboat, who carries people between the land of Lagash and the emporium of the Land, Larsa.</p>
<p>“I have a dear sister in the North that will want to know about our plan.  I will take my leave from you my lady and set sail for the underworld.”  Enki told Nintu.</p>
<p>We first traveled to Ur and established the Traveler Shrine at Ur.  We employed the help of an Igigi from Ur to work in the ovens of the shrine.  We established fresh water, for drinking and bathing, we established the tradition of washing oneself before continuing on one&#39;s path, reflecting upon the nature of your existence and where you fit into the plan of manifestation.  I, as Enki&#39;s minister, told the people of Ur of the ways and means of the shrine, and they grew in admiration for Enki.  Enki had brought joy to the people there at Ur.</p>
<p>He then boarded his boat and traveled to the very northern region.  In Sippar, we established the ways and means of the shrine, and they too grew in adoration for Enki.  Enki had brought joy to their people in Sippar as well.</p>
<p>We employed the locals and the Igigi of the region to build the two watercourses between Sippar and Kish, then Sippar to Kutu.  First, we built the canal from Sippar to Kish, then onto the lands of his brother in Nippur.  At Nippur, we were greeted in most warm fashion by his brother Enlil and his wife Ninlil.  Enki informed his brother that he could not stay long but that he would return after building the E.Absu and bring a bounty from his land in tribute to the new city of Nippur.</p>
<p>He brother upon hearing plans of the canal system insisted that we stay.  We sat and discussed the matter for some time.  He requested that there be an additional canal built through the center of Nippur; it seems that Enlil had just then been sitting down to draw out the plans for his holy city, Nippur with its house the magnificent E.Kur.</p>
<p>Enki realized it would be even more effective in carving water into the arid yet fertile soil and assigns a team of Igigi to establish a canal through An&#39;s holy city of Kish, through Nippur to Shuruppak.  Enki and Enlil both agreed that they must be protectors of the people in this new land, Shepherds of the land, to watch over the people and the descendants of An alike.  Enki told him about establishing the shrine in Ur, how he had established the rites of feeding and watering the travelers and strangers that come through the land.  They sat for many hours discussing things as brothers will do.</p>
<p>Enlil treated me personally very graciously and cared for my every want and desire.  Such a gracious host he was!  He truly is a Mouthpiece of Heaven like all the people had told me.  We talked of our mutual success and the hard work of the Igigi, working day and night to bring water and food throughout the city-states.  We agreed at how it warmed our spirits to see all the descendants of An and local people alike, to see the Anunnaki and the Igigi alike shoulder to shoulder, coming together to build something so very complex, so very large, something so grand that the likes of which had never before been seen in this land.</p>
<p>We continued on to the Lands of Nergal, the Fierce Lands of Shuruppak, the great Lion of the Land of Sumer.  We finish the mighty Shuruppak canal system by connecting it back to the River Euphrates.</p>
<p>We then continue to the city of Larsa.  Our teams were very tired and spent some time resting and relaxing in the beautiful city.  It seemed as if this city was brighter than the rest, it seem that everyone had a cheery thing to say and a sparkle in their eye.    The land around Larsa was already a field of abundance, the fields would be perfect for grazing of cattle. The clay here would create wonderful things.  They could establish a standard here for the bricks of the land so that our buildings would not fall down.  They could establish, here in the grand emporium of the land Larsa, the standard for humans so that our society would not fall down.</p>
