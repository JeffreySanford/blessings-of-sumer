<p>So having mastered the realms of the Mountains and Ereshkigal prize, Enki and I continued downstream towards Adab, the region of the Holy Mountain of Sumer, Ninhursag.  What a joy Ninhursag is, she at times seems so old that she seems to be as old as the mountain.  At times, she seems as young as the baby animals that she always seems to have around her city.  There is a beauty in her that is beyond anything else in the land.  She seems to have the ability to understand and speak to the animals.  She says that she is not speaking but just being a good ear that the animals can discuss things with.</p>
<p>Her city will be the bolt between the Heaven and the Earth regions.  Her city, Adab is absolutely beautiful.  The Lagash canal will link to her city first, after the reservoir of Kutu.  Nintu was there when the spirit of the city Adab and Umma was born; truly Nintu is the midwife of the Land.  Nintu will rule in mercy in Umma, Ninhursag in Understanding at Adab.  Next we established a canal link the newly created reservoir of Kutu to the House of Rule in Nippur.  Nintu gave birth to the spirit of the city Nippur, Ninsar, the Lady of Rightful Rule.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enki and Ninhursag
<a href="http://www.etcsl.com" target="_blank">http://www.etcsl.com</a></p>
<p>63-68 All alone the wise one, toward Nintud, the country&apos;s mother, Enki, the wise one, toward Nintud, the country&apos;s mother, was digging his phallus into the dykes, plunging his phallus into the reed beds. The august one pulled his phallus aside and cried out: &quot;No man take me in the marsh.&quot;</p>
<p>69-74 Enki cried out: &quot;By the life&apos;s breath of heaven I adjure you. Lie down for me in the marsh, lie down for me in the marsh, that would be joyous.&quot; Enki distributed his semen destined for Damgalnuna. He poured semen into Ninhursaja&apos;s womb and she conceived the semen in the womb, the semen of Enki.</p>
<p>75-87 But her one month was one day, but her two months were two days, but her three months were three days, but her four months were four days, but her five months were five days, but her six months were six days, but her seven months were seven days, but her eight months were eight days, but her nine months were nine days. In the month of womanhood, like juniper oil, like juniper oil, like oil of abundance, Nintud, mother of the country, like juniper oil, gave birth to Ninsar.</p>
<p>88-96 In turn Ninsar went out to the riverbank. Enki was able to see up there from in the marsh, he was able to see up there, he was. He said to his minister Isimud: &quot;Is this nice youngster not to be kissed? Is this nice Ninsar not to be kissed?&quot; His minister Isimud answered him: &quot;Is this nice youngster not to be kissed? Is this nice Ninsar not to be kissed? My master will sail, let me navigate. He will sail, let me navigate.&quot;</p>
<p>97-107 First he put his feet in the boat, next he put them on dry land. He clasped her to the bosom, kissed her, Enki poured semen into the womb and she conceived the semen in the womb, the semen of Enki. But her one month was one day, but her two months were two days, but her nine months were nine days. In the month of womanhood, like juniper oil, like juniper oil, like oil of abundance, Ninsar, like juniper oil, like juniper oil, like oil of abundance, gave birth to Ninkura.</p>
<p>108-116 In turn Ninkura went out to the riverbank. Enki was able to see up there from in the marsh, he was able to see up there, he was. He said to his minister Isimud: &quot;Is this nice youngster not to be kissed? Is this nice Ninkura not to kissed?&quot; His minister Isimud answered him: &quot;Kiss this nice youngster. Kiss this nice Ninkura. My master will sail, let me navigate. He will sail, let me navigate.&quot;</p>
<p>126A-126K Ninkura in turn gave birth to Ninimma. She brought the child up and made her flourish. Ninimma in turn went out to the riverbank. Enki was towing his boat along and was able to see up there, ....... He laid eyes on Ninimma on the riverbank and said to his minister Isimud: &quot;Have I ever kissed one like this nice youngster? Have I ever made love to one like nice Ninimma?&quot; His minister Isimud answered him: &quot;My master will sail, let me navigate. He will sail, let me navigate.&quot;</p>
<p>126L-126Q First he put his feet in the boat, next he put them on dry land. He clasped her to the bosom, lying in her crotch, made love to the youngster and kissed her. Enki poured semen into Ninimma&apos;s womb and she conceived the semen in the womb, the semen of Enki.</p>
<p>126R-126CC To the woman its one month was but its one day, its two months were but its two days, its three months were but its three days, its four months were but its four days, its five months were but its five days, its six months were but its six days, its seven months were but its seven days, its eight months were but its eight days, and at its nine days, in the month of womanhood, like juniper oil, like juniper oil, like oil of abundance, Ninimma, like juniper oil, like oil of abundance, gave birth to Uttu, the exalted (?) woman.)</p>

<p>We then continued the finished the Lagash Canal System in Lagash, after bringing waters to Girsu.  Lagash is a mighty lion in the land a protectorate of the people.     We established the Lagash to Larsa ferry canal and then in Shuruppak upstream we created the diversion of the water, to keep the lands watered yet dry, from Shuruppak to Adab.  In Larsa, Nintu joined us again to give birth to the spirit of the city Larsa; Ninimma seemed a fitting choice for me, which made me proud because Nintu is much wiser than I.</p>
<p>It took about nine days for the canals to be established per city it seemed from looking over the logbooks, that in comparison to the nine months that it would take for the towns themselves to build the canals sections themselves.  Those teams back then, Anunnaki, Igigi and local people alike, the Martu who have no house save for a tent, even pitched in to help build the beautiful cities. I cannot stress how much we stood in awe of those teams back in those days building the nation.  I shall remember those days forever.</p>
<p>To finish up the watercourses of the Land, we traveled to Erech.  We built a special canal divert below Shuruppak off the river Euphrates, exclusively for the sweet one Uttu, who already grew such lovely vegetable for the entire land of the KiUr.</p>
