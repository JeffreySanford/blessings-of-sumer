<p>Narrative transitional voice between Ninsikila and Enki]
Drifting in and out of sleep, inebriated from the last of their mead that they had brought with him, he flirted with Ninsikila.  “My lady, my rest is so good here.  It seems to me to be paradise.  Come here and lay with me!  To you, I have given the first city!  To you I have given Dilmun!  Come, slide into my embrace and feel the security of my protection.  Enjoy the sunrise, from the eastern mountains with me.  Let us intertwine our arms and legs in an embrace so complete that we are as one.  Let us think of beautiful children.  My lady, you are such a beauty and adore you.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enki and Ninhursag
<a href="http://www.etcsl.com" target="_blank">http://www.etcsl.com</a></p>
<p>5-10 He laid her down all alone in Dilmun, and the place where Enki had lain down with his spouse, that place was still virginal, that place was still pristine. He laid her down all alone in Dilmun, and the place where Enki had lain down with Ninsikila, that place was virginal, that place was pristine.</p>
<p>11-16 In Dilmun the raven was not yet cawing, the partridge not cackling. The lion did not slay, the wolf was not carrying off lambs, the dog had not been taught to make kids curl up, the pig had not learned that grain was to be eaten.</p>
<p>17-19 When a widow had spread malt on the roof, the birds did not yet eat that malt up there. The pigeon then did not tuck its head under its wing.</p>
<p>20-26 No eye-diseases said there: &quot;I am the eye disease.&quot; No headache said there: &quot;I am the headache.&quot; No old woman belonging to it said there: &quot;I am an old woman.&quot; No old man belonging to it said there: &quot;I am an old man.&quot; No maiden in her unwashed state ...... in the city. No man dredging a river said there: &quot;It is getting dark.&quot; No herald made the rounds in his border district.</p>
<p>27-28 No singer sang an elulam there. No wailings were wailed in the city&#39;s outskirts there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He reached for her wrap, knowing full well she was too tired from the voyage and meeting the people from around the area to grant any of his wishes.  As the sea gentle washed up onto the beach Enki’s beloved Ninsikila spoke to him.  “Enki, you have blessed my life with this new and beautiful paradise.  We have traveled far and my memory of our native land quickly fades.  This destiny that you have decreed in this bounty of a land is all I can think of for my future.  This city, however that you have given me?  You have given a city.  What does your giving avail me?  There is no river quay, there is no river.  I am on a barren island, how am I supposed to build a city out of just this?”  Ninsikila sat in the dust weeping, not knowing how to get fresh water instead of bitter salt water to her fields, to her city, to her very people that have already gathered here.</p>
<p>“How is it possible that my city,” the lovely lady Ninsikila continued, “on this island prosper and become a center of abundance without water.  You have given a city.  What does your giving avail me?  You may be able to drink mead all the time but I am thirsty!  My city has not even a river quay for passing ship to dock at.  We are on an island, it is dry here, and there are no sweet waters for fields, glebe or furrow!  How possible can my city, or any of the cities prosper without these things we need.  The people will be thirsty my beloved!”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>29-32 Ninsikila said to her father Enki: &quot;You have given a city. You have given a city. What does your giving avail me? You have given a city, Dilmun. You have given a city. What does your giving avail me? You have given ....... You have given a city. What does your giving avail me?&quot;</p>
<p>33-39&quot;You have given ......, a city that has no river quay. You have given a city. What does your giving avail me? A city that has no fields, glebe or furrow.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was so much to do!  He jumped up hearing Ninsikila&#39;s words.  He pondered to himself the actual difference between Ninsikila and his mother Nammu, not much he conclude as they both could motivate him in about ten words.  When father An took responsibility for the heavens as his own, and his brother Enlil took responsibility for the Earth as his own, this land had been establish.  Two great rivers ran down through this valley from the gorgeous mountains to the north, The Euphrates to the west and the Tigris to the east.  By the sea to the south, the land had embraced the river and the sea, creating miles and miles of swamp land.</p>
<p>&#39;Those have to go first&#39;, he thought to himself, ‘This land will be fertile and abundant in the future with a little hard work.  Canals could be built to drain the swamps and irrigate the land.  Over the Land we will divert the rivers into the cities.  Underneath the cities, in the great basin that lies under the surface of the earth, we will augment the waters with the water of the Tigris via the water of Lake {} and the water of the Euphrates, via the waters of Lake {}.  This will cause the great pool of the palace of Ereshkigal to swell, to sustain the shrines and wells around the countries of Sumer.  Thankfully the Martu have mapped these out for us.&#39;  Enki mused to himself as the gentle sea cradled his little boat, his Stag of the Absu as he gently drifted towards destiny.</p>
<p>He remembered meeting the Martu and how gracious they were.  They greeted him warmly and they exchanged gifts.  They were quite different form his and the culture that he was used to but they were strong, brilliantly smart, they knew honor and were fierce warriors when crossed.  They would be an excellent ally to keep as there were other tribes in the area that could cause them problems.  Some of the different tribes in the area were not quite as civilized as the Martu, they were barbaric in fact.  They were fierce wild animals which were very dangerous on occasion.</p>
<p>He had mused to himself as he left the Martu that their skin was lighter than his, still a beautiful rich color similar to the olives his mother grew in the days that he was young.  So plentiful was the harvest then, in those distant days of his youth and now all they ate was dates.  He was still thankful for the exchange of gifts from Martu.  They were a gracious people, very simple and true, like this land here in the new world, so pristine, so virginal.</p>
<p>He took a date seed and penetrated the virgin soil, deep dark rich and abundant with life giving energies.  Gently he covered the seed and placed his right hand over it.  He could feel the seed awaken and stretch, bursting from its outer shell.  Yearning, it reached out for his hand bursting forth from the ground into a sprouted sapling.  “How did that happen?”  Ninsikila astounded queried Enki.</p>
<p>{Enki ponders not only the fact that there is no water but the island cannot support itself in material goods, gold, wood, etc…  Having traveled to these different land, they have already offered to provide each of the goods from their respective cities.  Having Dilmun be the collection point, and in turn create the first trace center of the land would not only solve the initial problems but eventually cause the entire nation to prosper}</p>
<p>“Ninsikila, my beloved queen!” He cried out far too dramatically, “Your city shall have water!  It is true!  You are clever and have a mind for planning!  For your city to prosper, it must have water!  The Lands to the north have rivers that feed into caves.  Those caves create an aquifer under this land.  Fresh sweet waters that we can drink, water the crops, and bake with.  I will spend the rest of the day here and build a fountain that we, and the people that come here, can refresh themselves with.”</p>
<p>{this needs to describe how he tapped into the water aquifer underneath the island of Dilmun.  This should include the actual mechanism for tapping a well into the aquifer, perhaps with the help of Martu who would know how to tap wells}</p>
<p>“We should consider the waters of the aquifer, that region is the Land of Ereshkigal, in the new city that she has claimed as Kutu.  None of the Living may venture there just as none of the dead may venture into the Land of the Living.  I shall visit my sister, the first born daughter of An.  For you my queen, I shall first decree these things for you!”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>40-43  “When Utu steps up into heaven, fresh water shall run out of the ground for you from the standing vessels (these fountains here) on Ezen&#39;s (the eastern) shore, from Nanna&#39;s radiant temple, from the mouth of the waters running underground”</p>
<p>44-49  “May the waters rise up from it into your great basins.  May your city drink water a plenty from them.  May your pools of salt water become pools of fresh water.  May your city become an emporium of the quay for the Land.  May Dilmun become an emporium on the quay for the Land.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“From our journeys with the Martu, we have met the people of the land of Tukric and they have agreed to help us in our plans, they can provide your cities gold and lapis lazuli from Harali.  We have met the people of Meluhha, we met the people of Magan, in northern Meluhha and they have agreed to help in our plans, they can provide barges full of precious desirable comelian (for what???),   the people of Magan have agreed to present us with mec wood and the best abba wood, all loaded and delivered in large ships.”</p>
<p>“Magan can also provide you with all the strong, powerful metal copper, dolerite and two strong stones, the u and cumin stone.  We met the people of the land of Marhaci and they have sent you topazes, beautiful precious stones.”</p>
<p>“From the Sea Lands, you have the ebony wood fit for a king as a resource.  From the Tent-lands, you have the resources of fine multicolored wools.  The land of Elam, to the east, has a stockpile of wools that you can consider yours, as the people of that land of Elam pledged to assist us as did all the others.  The people have established a shrine to Ninhursag and a manor in Ur and have warehouse that contain sesame, august raiment, and fine cloth.”</p>
<p>“All the people of this new land are very excited about our plans here.  May your city be so blessed by abundance my lovely lady.  May you be an excellent queen in praise!  The very wide sea, my mother Nammu will present you with its wealth!”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>49A-49P &quot;May the land of Tukric hand over to you gold from Harali, lapis lazuli and ....... May the land of Meluha load precious desirable cornelian, mec wood of Magan and the best abba wood into large ships for you. May the land of Marhaci yield you precious stones, topazes. May the land of Magan offer you strong, powerful copper, dolerite, u stone and cumin stone. May the Sea-land offer you its own ebony wood, ...... of a king. May the &#39;Tent&#39;-lands offer you fine multicolored wools. May the land of Elam hand over to you choice wools, its tribute.

<p>49Q-49V The city&#39;s dwellings are good dwellings. Dilmun&#39;s dwellings are good dwellings. Its grains are little grains, its dates are big dates, its harvests are triple ......, its wood is ...... wood.)</p>
